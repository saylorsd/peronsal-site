      <h2>Early Bio</h2>
      <p>
        Bit was born on the streets of Monroeville, PA sometime in April 2019.
        Bit, her sister and her brother Max were fostered by a colleague of
        mine. Bit and her sister bonded quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the time, my mom and I were each looking to adopt; I was looking for
        a bonded pair while my mom was looking for a singleton.
      </p>
      <p>
        Max moved up to my Mom&apos;s as soon as he was ready. However, I
        couldn&apos;t adopt the girls for another month while I moved out of my
        apartment. During that time, Bit&apos;s sister, who was having
        development troubles, was seriously injured during a bout of kitten
        rough-housing and had to be euthanized.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of that summer, Bit moved in with me and we&apos;ve been best
        buds ever since.
